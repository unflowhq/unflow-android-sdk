# Change Log

## 1.14.0
### Changes
- When you have a page with a single select question block, it will no longer automatically close after selection.
- When you have a carousel with a single select question block, it will no longer automatically push the next page after selection.
- The pause function will now also prevent screens from push notifications from showing. When you pause the SDK and a user opens a push, it will only show the screen after you've called resume.
- When a user selects a button with a deeplink, we'll close our actvity for you.

### Added
- You can now configure if a question requires a response or not.

### Fixed
- We've improved the layouts for our visual screens to hug most of the time, and flex when it would look better.
- When closing a page via a link, the animation has been corrected.

## 1.13.1
### Fixed
- Modals with small content will now self-size correctly.

## 1.13.0
### Changes
- Images will now display with a maximum height, ensuring that on smaller devices the experience is improved without compromising on larger devices.

### Changes

### Added
- A new standalone free text entry that doesn't require an other option.

### Fixed
- The order of the events fired on screen dismiss will now be in the correct order.

## 1.12.0
### Changes
- We've bumped our versions up to use a newer stable compose, `1.2.1`. You may have to increase your Kotlin version and minimum compile sdk as a result of this change.
- The event for question selections will include the strings for each selection, not just the identifiers.
- The rating block will now not always close the screen. It will decide if it should progress the container or close depending on its location.
